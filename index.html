                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Tyler. I'm an aspiring web developer based in Colorado, but originally from the great state of North Carolina. I'm developing my skills in the programming industry, as seen it's not going anywhere soon, with hopes of making a career for myself in web development and seeing the world. Currently I work in the service and hospitality industry as a server at a seafood restaurant, but I can't wait for the day I can say I can work effectively from anywhere in the world, as long as I have my laptop and a power outlet (Wi-fi wouldn't hurt). I love to travel and am excited to start a career in which that may be more realistic. Being able to pursue your career no matter where you are on this planet is a possibility I am eager to experience. So much to code. So many places to go.</p>
