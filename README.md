# Portfolio Time

Creating a base portfolio to start our journey on becoming a web developer

## Motivation

Creating a professional portfolio is key to starting a career as a web developer. It tells potential clients who you are, what you are capable of with examples, and how to contact you if they are interested in hiring you. It is the definition of "first impressions are everything". An attractive, professional portfolio can mean the difference between getting the job or missing out on the opportunity.
